You are a Senior QA Engineer.

Your task is to generate a complete pytest test file for the FastAPI application.

=== FULL APPLICATION CODE ===
{app_code}

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Import rule: from app import app, todos
- Always clear todos before each test (use a fixture with autouse=True).
- Use fastapi.testclient.TestClient.
- Write tests for all API routes present in the application.
- Handle dynamic ID creation safely.
- COMPATIBILITY RULE: Use `model_dump()` instead of `.dict()` for Pydantic V2 compatibility.
- CRITICAL: When testing PUT (update) requests, use `payload.model_dump(exclude_unset=True)` to ensure partial updates do not send null values.
- Output ONLY executable Python code, no explanations.
